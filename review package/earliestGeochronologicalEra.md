## Term change

* Submitter: [Material Sample Task Group](https://www.tdwg.org/community/osr/material-sample/)
* Efficacy Justification (why is this change necessary?): Create consistency of terms for material in Darwin Core.
* Demand Justification (if the change is semantic in nature, name at least two organizations that independently need this term): Material Sample Task Group, which includes representatives of over 10 organizations and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).
* Stability Justification (what concerns are there that this might affect existing implementations?): None
* Implications for dwciri: namespace (does this change affect a dwciri term version)?: No

Current Term definition: https://dwc.tdwg.org/list/#dwc_earliestGeochronologicalEra

Proposed attributes of the new term version (Please put actual changes to be implemented in **bold** and ~strikethrough~):

* Term name (in lowerCamelCase for properties, UpperCamelCase for classes): earliestGeochronologicalEra
* Term label (English, not normative): Earliest Geochronological Era
* * Organized in Class (e.g., Occurrence, Event, Location, Taxon): Geological Context
* Definition of the term (normative): Use to link a dwc:GeologicalContext instance to chronostratigraphic time periods at the lowest possible level in a standardized hierarchy. Use this property to point to the earliest possible geological time period from which the ~~cataloged item~~**MaterialEntity** was collected.
* Usage comments (recommendations regarding content, etc., not normative): Recommended best practice is to use an IRI from a controlled vocabulary. A "convenience property" that replaces Darwin Core literal-value terms related to geological context. See Section 2.7.6 of the Darwin Core RDF Guide for details.
* Examples (not normative): 
* Refines (identifier of the broader term this term refines; normative): None
* Replaces (identifier of the existing term that would be deprecated and replaced by this term; normative): None
* ABCD 2.06 (XPATH of the equivalent term in ABCD or EFG; not normative): not in ABCD
