## Working Revision
### Term change

* Submitter: TDWG MaterialSample Task Group
* Efficacy Justification (why is this change necessary?): Deprecate this term for consolidation of physical objects into the class MaterialSample rather than including specific classes for different kinds of physical objects which can be covered under materialSamplType
* Demand Justification (if the change is semantic in nature, name at least two organizations that independently need this term): 
* Stability Justification (what concerns are there that this might affect existing implementations?): 
* Implications for dwciri: namespace (does this change affect a dwciri term version)?: Yes

Current Term definition: https://dwc.tdwg.org/list/#dwc_FossilSpecimen

Proposed attributes of the new term version (Please put actual changes to be implemented in **bold** and ~strikethrough~):

* Term name (in lowerCamelCase for properties, UpperCamelCase for classes): ~FossilSpecimen~
* Organized in Class (e.g., Occurrence, Event, Location, Taxon): 
* Definition of the term (normative): ~A preserved specimen that is a fossil.~
* Usage comments (recommendations regarding content, etc., not normative): 
* Examples (not normative): ~A body fossil. A coprolite. A gastrolith. An ichnofossil. A piece of a petrified tree.~
* Refines (identifier of the broader term this term refines; normative): 
* Replaces (identifier of the existing term that would be deprecated and replaced by this term; normative): 
* ABCD 2.06 (XPATH of the equivalent term in ABCD or EFG; not normative):~RecordBasisEnum/FossileSpecimen~
