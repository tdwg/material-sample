# Working Revision
## Term change

* Submitter: TDWG MaterialSample Task Group
* Efficacy Justification (why is this change necessary?): The current definition includes information that belongs in usage comments or examples and also relies upon an action (sampling) which the Task Group feels is unnecessary. We wanted to provide a simple definition that could be used by many disciplines.
* Demand Justification (if the change is semantic in nature, name at least two organizations that independently need this term): 
* Stability Justification (what concerns are there that this might affect existing implementations?): 
* Implications for dwciri: namespace (does this change affect a dwciri term version)?: Yes

Current Term definition: https://dwc.tdwg.org/list/#dwc_MaterialSample

Proposed attributes of the new term version (Please put actual changes to be implemented in **bold** and ~strikethrough~):

* Term name (in lowerCamelCase for properties, UpperCamelCase for classes): MaterialSample
* Organized in Class (e.g., Occurrence, Event, Location, Taxon): MaterialSample
* Definition of the term (normative): ~A physical result of a sampling (or subsampling) event. In biological collections, the material sample is typically collected, and either preserved or destructively processed.~ **A physical object that represents a physical entity of interest in whole or in part.**
* Usage comments (recommendations regarding content, etc., not normative): **In biological collections, the material sample is typically collected, and either preserved or destructively processed. Material samples can preserve their identity even while gaining and losing material parts. See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(material)**
* Examples (not normative): ~A whole organism preserved in a collection. A part of an organism isolated for some purpose. A soil sample. A marine microbial sample.~ **the undetached leg of an animal, an aggregate of animals, an animal, soil, water, a museum collection object, a vial of tissue**
* Refines (identifier of the broader term this term refines; normative): 
* Replaces (identifier of the existing term that would be deprecated and replaced by this term; normative): 
* ABCD 2.06 (XPATH of the equivalent term in ABCD or EFG; not normative): DataSets/DataSet/Units/Unit
