### Items for discussion
#### 10AM MDT
1. Existing terms in the milestone  
     a. Other Deliverable - preparations review - organize it under MaterialEntity and leave the problems for the next task group.  
          i. Examples - fossil, cast, photograph, DNA extract, skin | skull | skeleton, whole animal (ETOH) | tissue (EDTA)  
               1. Commas separate individual examples, but this makes the examples appear to not follow the recommended best practice  
               2. Should be viewed as  
                    a. fossil  
                    b. cast  
                    c. photograph  
                    d. DNA extract  
                    e. skin | skull | skeleton  
                    f. whole animal (ETOH) | tissue (EDTA)  
               3. CB suggests that the term notes should be updated to clarify the syntax in which these lists of value pairs are recommended to be written, including cases in which one of the values is absent. This is a domestic / housekeeping improvement to the current term and doesn’t change any semantics or current use of the term (could be done as an independent term change request rather than part of TG recommendations)  
          ii. Comments - Recommended best practice is to separate the values in a list with space vertical bar space ( | ).  
               1. Suggest adding parentheses as part of the syntax in the comments - but this just encodes bad practices and requires review of all syntax.  
     b. [Other Deliverable - associatedSequences review](https://github.com/tdwg/material-sample/issues/9) - belongs with MaterialEntity - change definition accordingly.
