New Term Proposal - MaterialEntity
https://github.com/tdwg/dwc/issues/426 
https://github.com/tdwg/material-sample/issues/34 
Can we wrap this up and move on?
Yes - pick definition 2: An entity that can be identified, exists for some period of time, and consists in whole or in part of physical matter while it exists.
MaterialEntityID: An identifier for a particular instance of dwc:MaterialEntity.
Need to add in comments that his is preferable to MaterialSampleID
Make a package of materialEntity, MaterialEntityID and whatever is in Occurrence that goes with material as a package for review. - Target is May 1.
Does the Task Group need a new name - Material? Material Entity? Does it matter?
Steve says no because it is too much trouble
Stay Material Sample and move on
Term for Material dead or alive? Reuse proposed new term vitality?

Meeting Chat 10AM MDT
10:02:08 From  Steve Baskauf  to  Everyone:
	It will happen when it happens
10:03:08 From  Roger Burkhalter  to  Everyone:
	My new email is: rogerburkhalter1956@gmail.com
10:07:16 From  Dag Endresen  to  Everyone:
	(I have our meeting series twice in my calendar :-D)
10:07:56 From  John Wieczorek  to  Everyone:
	I have this meeting twice on my calendar as well.
10:09:02 From  John Wieczorek  to  Everyone:
	The definition will go through a public commentary again anyway.
10:10:26 From  Teresa Mayfield-Meyer  to  Everyone:
	This is the definition: An entity that can be identified, exists for some period of time, and consists in whole or in part of physical matter while it exists.
10:11:47 From  John Wieczorek  to  Everyone:
	I can‚Äôt talk.
10:11:51 From  John Wieczorek  to  Everyone:
	However...
10:12:01 From  John Wieczorek  to  Everyone:
	It isn‚Äôt a matter of need...
10:12:12 From  John Wieczorek  to  Everyone:
	It is a matter of the scope of what can be done if we have it.
10:12:37 From  John Wieczorek  to  Everyone:
	Without it we have essentially just one more basifOfRecord term.
10:12:51 From  John Wieczorek  to  Everyone:
	With it we can instantiate MaterialEntities.
10:17:21 From  Teresa Mayfield-Meyer  to  Everyone:
	MaterialEntityID: An identifier for a particular instance of dwc:MaterialEntity.
10:17:53 From  John Wieczorek  to  Everyone:
	Humans would be pointed in the right direction. It would break IPT mappings.
10:18:33 From  Steve Baskauf  to  Everyone:
	https://dwc.tdwg.org/list/#dwc_individualID
10:19:32 From  Stan Blum  to  Everyone:
	That would be my concern (breaking IPT mappings), but the way forward that is internally consistent. No?
10:19:33 From  Dag Endresen  to  Everyone:
	ID for the instyance
10:19:43 From  John Wieczorek  to  Everyone:
	Yes, IDs for the instances.
10:20:46 From  John Wieczorek  to  Everyone:
	MaterialEntity would be a class, materialEntityID would be a property organized in the MaterialEntity class.
10:23:39 From  Dag Endresen  to  Everyone:
	The bone is different curatorial entity from other bones fro the same organism‚Ä¶?
10:23:48 From  Dag Endresen  to  Everyone:
	Different materialID
10:24:27 From  Teresa Mayfield-Meyer  to  Everyone:
	The bone is different curatorial entity from other bones fro the same organism‚Ä¶?
	
	Could be - especially if something interesting was done with that particular bone
10:26:44 From  Dag Endresen  to  Everyone:
	Like each time you look at the bone you need a different ID for it (like occurrenceID)‚Ä¶
10:27:54 From  Teresa Mayfield-Meyer  to  Everyone:
	No, the bone would get an ID that you always use for that particular bone, which may have a parent, that is the whole skeleton with it's own ID
10:28:25 From  Dag Endresen  to  Everyone:
	That is how I see it too (just trying to stretch Juttas case)
10:30:57 From  Dag Endresen  to  Everyone:
	I think we need an ID for the material and a type for it
10:32:05 From  Stan Blum  to  Everyone:
	Are adding materialEntityID and deprecating materialSampleID two parts of the same proposal?  (I think so!)
10:32:32 From  John Wieczorek  to  Everyone:
	I would say let that be a different battle so as not to hold this one up.
10:33:13 From  John Wieczorek  to  Everyone:
	Getting rid of materialSampleID will after people and organizations.
10:33:20 From  John Wieczorek  to  Everyone:
	affect
10:33:38 From  Dag Endresen  to  Everyone:
	If ‚Äúdeprecating‚Äù materialSampleID would jeopardise the new MaterialEntiry then hold it, but better to replace it
10:33:39 From  John Wieczorek  to  Everyone:
	A goal could be to deprecate it someday.
10:33:52 From  John Wieczorek  to  Everyone:
	Lesson learned from trying to get rid of individualCount.
10:34:26 From  Steve Baskauf  to  Everyone:
	Reacted to "Lesson learned from ..." with üò©
10:35:09 From  John Wieczorek  to  Everyone:
	That would be a normative change.
10:36:16 From  John Wieczorek  to  Everyone:
	That sounds correct, Steve.
10:36:26 From  John Wieczorek  to  Everyone:
	Yes, Dag.
10:36:34 From  John Wieczorek  to  Everyone:
	That would be a good recoomendation.
10:37:22 From  John Wieczorek  to  Everyone:
	Another different and nasty battle.
10:43:34 From  John Wieczorek  to  Everyone:
	Roger, do you mean preparations?
10:43:44 From  John Wieczorek  to  Everyone:
	MaterialSample has no type term.
10:44:37 From  Jutta Buschbom  to  Everyone:
	Terms & Vocabularies https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12D6P4lt-zDAALJzod7sq475tWgqKiTbDrFjKEuSXVg4/edit?usp=sharing

10:46:00 From  Roger Burkhalter  to  Everyone:
	John, I‚Äôll check with Holly, but I recall it was for MaterialSample. We were looking at GBIF searchable terms and MaterialSample is the only was to return only Fossil material.
10:46:40 From  Roger Burkhalter  to  Everyone:
	Excuse mr, Basis of Record. Sorry
10:46:41 From  Dag Endresen  to  Everyone:
	Maybe Holly looked at values for basisOfRecord‚Ä¶?
10:51:52 From  John Wieczorek  to  Everyone:
	I hate to, but I have to go. The proposed path forward sounds perfect.
10:59:57 From  Dag Endresen  to  Everyone:

11:00:26 From  Dag Endresen  to  Everyone:
	‚ÄúHow did it die‚Äù ‚Ä¶

	Thank you Steve
